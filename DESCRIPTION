Description: The `riskassessment` application allows users to define a list of R
    packages to assess against metrics engineered by the `riskmetric` package.
    In general, those metrics evaluate package development best practices, code
    documentation, community engagement, and sustainability that culminate in a
    quantitative risk score. The app allows users to select and review one package
    at a time to consume interactive visuals, download reports for sharing, submit
    comments for group collaboration, and even tweak metric weights used to
    calculate the packages' risk scores. When deployed in the context of an
    organization, the app serves as a platform for package validation, offering an
    authentication wall where roles are assigned to various users and 'final
    decisions' can be made at the package level.
