</h2>
<p>Welcome! This guide will help users get started with the
<code>riskassessment</code> application for the first time. For more
information about how to deploy the application, please reference the <a href="./Deployment.html"><code>Deployment</code></a> guide. And note:
this guide assumes you have already downloaded the
<code>riskassessment</code> package &amp; all of it’s dependencies
following the <a href="../index.html#installation">installation
instructions</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="run-deploy-app-r">Run / Deploy <code>app.R</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#run-deploy-app-r"></a>
</h2>
<p>If your application is already deployed, you can skip this step!
After you have <a href="../index.html#installation">installed</a> the
<code>riskassessment</code> package, you are now able to run the app
locally using the <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/blob/master/app.R" class="external-link">provided</a>
<code>app.R</code> file. If applicable, you can specify application
options in this file, using either <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html" class="external-link">options()</a></code> or arguments
of the <code><a href="../reference/run_app.html">run_app()</a></code> function (run
<code><a href="../reference/run_app.html">?riskassessment::run_app</a></code> to learn more). However, for the
purposes of this guide, we’ll run the function as-is, accepting all
defaults:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>The first page you’ll see is an authentication screen with a default
note on the bottom: <b> NOTE: TO LOG IN FOR THE FIRST TIME, USE THE
ADMIN USER: <u>ADMIN</u> WITH PASSWORD <u>QWERTY1</u>.</b> If you
recall, the application acts as a central hub for an organization to
review and assess the risk of R packages, thus establishing users with
specific roles is vital. To start, the application needs an
<code>admin</code> user.</p>
<p><br></p>
<center>
<img src="images/initial_login.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This <code>admin</code> user will be asked to change their password
immediately. After supplying a new secure password, click “UPDATE NEW
PASSWORD”. When the password was successfully updated, you’ll be
prompted to “LOGIN” again with your new credentials.</p>

creating new users, with both <code>admin</code> and non-admin roles.
For <code>admin</code>s, please see the article titled <a href="../articles/Credential_Manager.html">“Credential Manager”</a> on
how to create these new users. For non-admin roles, you will receive a
temporary password for your initial log in, which you’ll be prompted to
change with immediately upon your first visit to the app. For subsequent
visits, you won’t have to worry about all these first-time log in
procedures!</p>

<h2 id="upload-a-package">Upload a package<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#upload-a-package"></a>
</h2>
<p>Now to the main event - let’s upload some packages to review &amp;
assess for our organization. If it’s your first time using the app, an
empty database will be initialized on app launch to be populated with
packages, their <code>riskmetric</code> outputs, and your organization’s
assessment preferences. To begin filling the database with package info,
we’ll need to start by upload a list of packages we want to review.
Under the <code>Risk Assessment</code> tab, the main panel is titled,
<code>R PACKAGE RISK ASSESSMENT APP</code> with four tabs under it. By
default, you’ll be directed to the <code>Upload Package</code> tab.</p>
<p>Uploading packages can be done by manually typing one (or more)
package names into the prompt or, if you have a long list of packages to
asses, it may be more convenient to upload a CSV file of the package
names. The CSV file requires two columns: “package” and “version.”
However, right now <code>riskmetric</code> can only tackle the current
version, so the version column is ignored. In the meantime, you can make
your life easier by setting version to “0.0.0” for all of your packages
in the CSV. Additionally, a third column “decision” can be included.
This can be helpful if your organization already has a list of packages
approved for use.</p>
<p>A over simplified example of an acceptable CSV file:</p>
<pre><code>package,version
stringr,0.0.0
tidyr,0.0.0</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you may prefer to test the app by typing in a package,
such as “glue” into the prompt. Notice that the text input will
pre-populate itself with all CRAN packages upon click, thus if you
forget the spelling or case of the package, the auto-complete feature
can assist your. When ready, select the red “&gt;” button</p>
<center>
<img src="images/sel_package_v2.0.0.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">
</center>
<p>A progress modal like the one below will appear indicating the
process of generating package info from various sources has begun and
the app will start inserting this information into the database.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/progress_modal.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0" width="382" height="157">
</center>
<p>Upon completion, a “Summary of Uploaded Packages” section will
display. This lists the total packages uploaded, the number of packages
that were new to the database, the number of undiscovered (probably
misspelled) packages, and the number of duplicate packages,
i.e. packages that already existed in the database.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/uploaded_pkgs.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="decision-automation">Decision Automation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#decision-automation"></a>
</h2>
<p>If your organization has black and white rules about package risk
decisions based solely on <code>riskmetric</code> scores, then decision
automation is for you. When leveraged, it will help you automatically
classify packages into the “Low”, “Medium”, or “High” risk decision
categories upon upload. This automation saves your review team time and
mental capacity when reviewing large groups of packages. The current
automation rules are always displayed on the ‘Upload Package’ tab.
Please note that only <code>admin</code> users have the necessary
privileges to edit. To get started, click on the small gear button in
the upper left hand corner</p>
<p><br></p>
<center>
<img src="images/start_decision_automation_v2.0.0.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>In a fictitious example below, let’s say an <code>admin</code> user
adopts automated decision rules for packages with risk scores less than
0.33 and greater than .66. Perhaps this organization has a policy that
mandates any package whose risk score falls between 0.33 and 0.66 will
need to be reviewed manually. After uploading a new CSV of packages, you
can see the ‘Summary of Uploaded Package(s)’ displays the number of
decisions made overall and by each risk category. Here, you can see that
10 packages were uploaded, and 5 automatic decisions were made: four
received the “low” designation and one was labeled as “high” risk. In
the summary table, the decisions are displayed with their respective
risk scores on the right-hand side. You can also observe that a few
packages weren’t found because they don’t exist on CRAN.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="sidebar">Sidebar<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sidebar"></a>
</h2>
<p>Now that the database has been populated with package data, direct
your attention to the <code>PACKAGE CONTROL PANEL</code> at left and
select a package (such as <code>glue</code>) from the list. Once a
package is selected, the <code>VERSION</code>, <code>STATUS</code> and
<code>RISK</code> boxes are populated with information. For now, the
latest version of the package is displayed. Since a decision to endorse
or reject the package hasn’t been made yet, the <code>STATUS</code> is
“Under Review”. Third, the <code>RISK</code> box contains the
<code>riskmetric</code> score, represented as a number between 0 (low
risk) and 1 (high risk).</p>
<center>
<img src="images/sidebar_v2.0.0.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">
</center>
<p>There are also two submission buttons above:
<code>SUBMIT DECISION</code> and <code>SUBMIT OVERALL COMMENT</code>.
The goal is that after a thorough review of other info contain in the
application, the user would be well informed enough to categorize the
package’s risk as either “low”, “medium”, or “high” risk using the
slider. Clicking submit here completes the review of this package for
the organization and can only be undone by an <code>admin</code> user.
If you’re looking submit something less formal, before submitting a
decision, consider submitting an “overall comment” summarizing your high
level thoughts on the package. Though it’s not required, it’s
recommended to always submit an “overall comment” when submitting a
final decision.</p>

<h2 id="package-metrics-review-tabs">‘Package Metrics’ Review Tabs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#package-metrics-review-tabs"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>Package Metrics</code> tab contains all the
<a href="https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/" class="external-link">riskmetric</a> derived assessments in one place, and
consolidates them into different like-kind groups for convenience-sake.
That is, metrics are sorted into either “Maintenance” or “Community
Usage” categories. As of the latest version of the app, a 3rd category
was added to better support the analysis of “Dependencies”, all of which
can be selected via the drop down at the top of the tab:</p>
<center>
<img src="images/metrics_dropdown_v2.0.0.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">
</center>
<p>It’s on these tabs that the bulk of the more automated review occurs
because each metric provides the context that determines the final
<code>riskmetric</code> score. We highly encourage users to become very
familiar with these metrics and decide which are most important to you
and your organization. As is available in <code>riskmetric</code>,
<code>riskassessment</code> allows <code>admin</code> users to set
organization-wide metric weights so that the risk score is based on the
most meaningful metrics, and reduces the influence of less important
metrics. Thus, if a metric is un-important to your org, we highly
recommend weighting it to 0. To learn more about these options, please
read through our <a href="../articles/Deployment.html#metric-weights-configuration">“Metric
weights configuration” guide</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a look at the Maintenance Metrics output for the “glue”
package:</p>
<center>
<img src="images/maint_metrics_v2.0.0.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">
</center>
<p>Each metric on this tab measures something related to package
maintenance best practices, whether it be storing the code on a public
URL, providing vignettes to guide users, or package authors sufficiently
giving attention to bugs. Note that some of the metrics will report that
an assessment is “Not Found”. That’s because this application uses the
“pkg_cran_remote” source when compiling metrics, which does not have the
capability to gather info for all possible metrics. There is a <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/299" class="external-link">on-going
effort</a> to build out more more information on these remote metrics.
To learn more, please explore more package assessment topics in the <a href="https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/reference/index.html" class="external-link">riskmetric
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Note that you can add or replace comments to the Maintenance Metrics
for this package, and review paste comments made by other users. This is
a great platform to not only form your opinions, but write them down for
others in your organization to read and consider during their
evaluation.</p>

package:</p>

<center>
<img src="images/comm_usage_metrics_v2.0.0.png" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0">
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each metric on this tab measures something related to the package’s
usage by the community. The user community plays an important role in
open source software development. In other words, the more exposure a
package has had to the community, the more ad-hoc testing it has been
exposed to. Over time the “better packages” tend to rise to the top,
leading to more downloads and increased exposure. Note that
<code>riskmetric</code> only considers the metric called
<code>Number of download in the last year</code> and
<code>Reverse Dependencies</code> for its risk score calculation. All
the other data presented on this tab are accessories to help the user
further explore the idea of community usage.</p>
<p>Notably, this tab includes a highly interactive visual, which shows
the number of downloads by month since the package was first released.
For more information on these metrics, explore package assessments in
the <a href="https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/reference/index.html" class="external-link">riskmetric
documentation</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Introduced in v2.0.0 of <code>riskassessment</code>, the
<code>Source Explorer</code> tab offers users a more manual, hands-on
approach to assessing packages by exploring the source contents of a
package. Just as if you were a developer forking a repository to explore
code, you can now page through any of the files bundled and stored on
CRAN. There are exceptions, however: certain file types that don’t
display well in a file browser, like RDS for example, aren’t compatible.
But most are; for example, we we are viewing the
<code>DESCRIPTION</code> file (which doesn’t have an extension) for the
<code>glue</code> package. The possibilities are truly endless when you
have access to the source code: can browse through R scripts containing
exported (or non-exported) functions, read contents of the
<code>LICENSE</code> file, or even explore the <code>tests/</code>
folder to inspect the robustness of a it’s unit tests. Just expand the
file tree on the left hand side to reveal the contents of those
folders.</p>

tab pulls all the information viewed on the previous tabs and
consolidates it down into an easy to browse report, downloaded as HTML,
DOCX, or PDF. However, first it gives the user ample control over what
they care to see in each report using check boxes, which are all
pre-checked by default. Optionally, there is a “Package Summary” section
which allows reviewers to log any and all information not explicit
acknowledged by the metrics, plots, risk-based decision, or comments.
This field will allow organizations to satisfy any custom documentation
needs that that the app is not privy to. Note that only one summary can
be logged per package, so after submitted, you cannot add another, but
must edit the existing summary is acceptable.</p>

co-workers comments. There’s really nothing left to do but make a final
decision. So what are you waiting for! Let’s do it!</p>
<p>Head over to the <code>Package Control Panel</code>. First we’ll
start off with an “Overall Comment”. Write a few words about what you’ve
learned during your evaluation We recommend being brief and succinct
here.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>After clicking submit, you’ll receive a prompt that just confirms
what you wrote. Click dismiss and now turn your attention to the
decision slider, with options “Low”, “Medium”, and “High”. Consider how
your organization may treat each category? For example, “Low” might mean
it’s permitted for use in regulatory environments, “Medium” may mean the
package isn’t fully endorsed yet, so it needs to stay in a holding
patter. “High” of course means rejection.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, we submitted a decision with
selection “Low” and received the following dialogue box asking us to
confirm our decision:</p>
<p><br></p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>After clicking ‘Submit’, you’ll notice the <code>STATUS</code> was
updated to “REVIEWED” and the decision slider is now disabled &amp;
grayed out. We are logged in as an <code>admin</code> user, so the
button now displays “RESET DECISION” but non-admin users will not have
that option.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve reviewed your first package! That was your
goal, you accomplished it. Now keep going, what are you waiting for? At
the time this guide was authored, there was 19,038 packages on CRAN and
your organization may want to use them!</p>

<h2 id="other-tabs">Other Tabs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-tabs"></a>
</h2>
<p>You may have noticed the navigation tabs at the top of the app
contain the following four tabs.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>All that work was performed on the first tab:
<code>Risk Assessment</code>. We’ll be painfully brief as we touch on
what the other tabs do, but just know there are more in-depth guides
that exist for each.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="database">Database<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#database"></a>
</h3>
<p>The second tab, <code>Database</code> shows, for each package loaded,
the package name and version, it’s <code>riskmetric</code> score,
whether a decision has been made, the decision, and timestamp for the
last comment provided. Reports (in either .html, .docx, or .pdf format)
can be downloaded for any selected package(s). If multiple packages are
selected, this This is really helpful</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="assessment-criteria">Assessment Criteria<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assessment-criteria"></a>
</h3>
<p>The third tab, <code>Assessment Criteria</code> provides a detailed
description of the assessment criteria used for Risk Calculation,
Maintenance Metrics, Community Usage Metrics, and Testing metrics. Each
metric even has a short description on why it was included in
<code>riskmetric</code>. The <code>Risk Calculation</code> tab is shown
below. Browse this tab for more information.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-tools">Administrative Tools<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#administrative-tools"></a>
</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>The fourth tab, <code>Administrative tools</code>, contains two
sub-tabs: the <code>Credential Manager</code> and the
<code>Assessment Reweighting</code>. The former allows
<code>admin</code> users to add or delete users as well as change
passwords for themselves or others. Further details on are provided in
the <a href="../articles/Credential_Manager.html">“Credential Manager”
guide</a></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The <code>Assessment Reweighting</code> tab is for <code>admin</code>
users to fine tune the package risk score generated by
<code>riskmetric</code> by manipulating the value placed on each of the
metrics assessed in the app. Changes made here apply to all packages in
the database, plus all packages uploaded in the future. Further details
are provided in the <a href="User_Roles_and_Privileges.html">“User Roles
and Privileges” guide</a>.</p>
