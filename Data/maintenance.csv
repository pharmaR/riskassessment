Metric,Measure,Reason for Inclusion
Package has vignette?,Yes/no,It is good practice to provide additional help documentation for a package in the form of one or more vignettes.
Package has website?,Yes/no,"It is good practice to maintain a website with further information about the package, contact details, and other supporting information."
Source code is public?,Yes/no,"The use of source control is good practice that facilitates development.  In general, it will not be possible to determine whether the maintainer is using a source code repository unless this is in the public domain."
Has BugReports?,Yes/no,"Bugs can be logged by emails, but the better practice is to provide a formal mechanism for bug tracking."
Has news feed?,Yes/no,"A news feed is good practice as it makes users aware of updates to the package, thereby highlighting the areas of greatest risk."
Exported objects with documentation,Percentage,"Users could choose to use any of the exported objects in a package.  The percentage of exported objects with documentation is a measure of the extent to which the developers have gone to ensure their package is usable by the end users.  Higher percentages indicate better documentation coverage."
Status of last 30 reported bugs,Percentage,"Where bugs are identified, it is important that they are dealt with accordingly.  The status of the last 30 bugs (or less) provides a measure of the speed with which bugs are categorised and dealt with.  The higher the percentage of closed bugs/issues, the better."
News is current,Yes/no,"The news feed is typically used to communicate new features / breaking changes to users.  If it is not current, there is a risk that users do not use the package in the way that it the author / maintainer intends."
Has a package maintainer,Yes/no,"Over time, there may be changes in the package dependencies (including system / third party dependencies).  Development standards may also evolve.  It is therefore important that a package is actively maintained to ensure it meets current standards and functions as originally intended. The absence of a maintainer therefore presents a risk."
License,Eg GPL-2,Certain licenses can be prohibitive and restrict the commercial use of a package.  The license should be noted and compared with an acceptable set of licenses as identified by an organisations legal team.
