# riskassessment (development version)

* Added new pdf report download option to 'Database' and 'Report Preview' tabs (#280) 
* Updated README to include more description, with a focus on improving the 'Usage' section, which now shows our audience how to install & run the app for the first time. Also, new links to the demo app & a short video walk through were added. Plus, very brief notes were included regarding deployment environments.
* Created a new argument for `run_app()` called `app_version` which allows deployment users to write their own custom app_version name via a text string. This is displayed on authentication screen and any downloaded reports. By default, it will display the installed version of `riskassessment`.
* Created a argument for `run_app()` called `login_note` which allows deployment users to add custom log-in notes on the authentication screen. By default, it now displays a note about how to use default usernames and passwords to gain entry for the first time.
* Fixed bug causing Community Usage metrics to not be added on Mac computers
* Fixed bug causing the report downloads to fail if no Community Metrics are available for a package. Instead a message is displayed "Community Usage Metrics not available for {package}"
