are a series of metrics underlying the risk calculation for any 
given package. The short-hand names for each metric are 
listed below with more detail provided on consecutive tabs.
To calculate a packages overall risk, 
each metric is assigned a quantitative value: the yes/no metrics (like 
<b>has_bug_reports_url</b>) recieve a 0 if 'no'
or a 1 if 'yes', while the quantitative metrics (like <b>bugs_status</b>'s percentage) 
remain as-is. Since a metric's
importance is subjective,  weights are applied to put more/less emphasis
on how certain metrics contribute to the over risk score.
The weights below were set by this app's admin(s) and are standardized so 
that each is between 0 and 1, and when summed, 
equal 1. The risk of a package will be determined by 1 - sum(metric's
numeric value <b>x</b> standardized weight)")
